# horiseon-refactorCH-01

## This project was to refactor a webpage for a Search Engine Optimization company. I wanted to make the code more effeciant for other people to view my code as well as make it more accesible for people using screen readers to navigate the page. My changes did not alter the appearance of the pre exisitng webpage, only altered the code inside of it. Primarily replacing exesive "Div" tags with semantic HTML elements we have learned during week 1.
